## Overview
Agentic-Chatbot is an end-to-end Python project for building an **agentic** chatbot — a conversational AI that composes multiple agents and tools (retrieval, function-calling, or external APIs) to solve user requests, perform actions, and return structured responses.

The repository currently contains an application entrypoint (`app.py`) and dependency specifications (`requirements.txt`). Use the files in `src/` for the main implementation (if present in the repo). For the original repository, see: https://github.com/shailovesingh/Agentic-Chatbot


## Features
- Multi-agent orchestration (agentic patterns)
- Tool / function calling support
- Retrieval-augmented responses (RAG) patterns can be plugged in
- Lightweight Flask/CLI/Gradio entrypoint (depending on `app.py` implementation)


## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (3.10/3.11 recommended)
- A virtual environment tool (`venv`, `pipenv`, or `conda`)
- API keys for any LLM provider you plan to use (OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Groq, etc.)
- Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`


## Installation
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shailovesingh/Agentic-Chatbot.git
cd Agentic-Chatbot

# create and activate virtual environment (example with venv)
python -m venv .venv
# On macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
